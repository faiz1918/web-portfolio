This portfolio includes several multimedia projects I completed during the semester, including image, audio, and animation work. The homepage covers my bio and interests, while the additional pages focus on specific projects perpetuated with media and texts describing the project. Embedding and styling media content on every page without compromising design responsiveness was the most difficult part. I overcame this challenge by implementing a common external CSS document containing predefined classes and controlled layout with media queries.
The intended audience for my portfolio encompasses prospective employers, transfer admissions officers, relatives, and friends interested in exploring my creative works. In designing the site, my primary objective was to ensure that it was lively and easy to read. To achieve this goal, I utilized CSS styling techniques such as color, font family, background color, padding, and margin. To enhance the user experience, I employed bright colors and clean modern fonts to reflect the joy and energy driven by my animation project.
